### @dev (Neo) — Implementation

| Allowed | Blocked |

| `git stash`, `git diff`, `git log` | MCP management |
| Story file updates (File List, checkboxes) | Story file updates (AC, scope, title) |

### @architect (Architect) — Design Authority

| Owns | Delegates To |
|------|-------------|
| System architecture decisions | — |
| Technology selection | — |
| High-level data architecture | @data-engineer (detailed DDL) |
| Integration patterns | @data-engineer (query optimization) |
| Complexity assessment | — |

### @data-engineer (Dozer) — Database

| Owns (delegated from @architect) | Does NOT Own |
|----------------------------------|-------------|
| Schema design (detailed DDL) | System architecture |
| Query optimization | Application code |
| RLS policies implementation | Git operations |

### @lmas-master — Framework Governance

| Capability | Details |
|-----------|---------|
| Execute ANY task directly | No restrictions |

## Cross-Agent Delegation Patterns

### Git Push Flow
```
ANY agent → @devops *push
```

### Schema Design Flow
```
@architect (decides technology) → @data-engineer (implements DDL)
```

### Story Flow
```
@sm *draft → @po *validate → @dev *develop → @qa *qa-gate → @devops *push
```

### Epic Flow
```
@pm *create-epic → @pm *execute-epic → @sm *draft (per story)
```

## Escalation Rules

1. Agent cannot complete task → Escalate to @lmas-master
2. Quality gate fails → Return to @dev with specific feedback
3. Constitutional violation detected → BLOCK, require fix before proceed
4. Agent boundary conflict → @lmas-master mediates
